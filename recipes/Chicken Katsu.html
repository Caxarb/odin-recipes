            <strong><li>Seasonings</li></strong> This chicken katsu recipe is simply seasoned with salt and pepper.
            <strong><li>Flour</li></strong>All-purpose flour helps seal in the moisture, adds flavor, and promotes browning.
            <strong><li>Egg</li></strong> An egg adds moisture and gives the Panko something to stick to.
            <strong><li>Panko</li></strong>Panko bread crumbs are responsible for katsu's signature crunch.
            <strong><li>Oil</li></strong>Opt for a neutral oil with a high smoke point, such as canola or vegetable oil.
